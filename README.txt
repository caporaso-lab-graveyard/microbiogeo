Much of our code and tutorials have been integrated into QIIME for the 1.5.0
release and removed from this area. The code that remains is in an incomplete
state and was not ready for the release.

Here is a brief breakdown of our directory structure:
  r: contains R scripts to allow us to test many of the methods.
  doc: contains our Sphinx documentation for the statistical methods that we
    researched. Each page contains notes about the method and testing results.
  python: contains Python code that hasn't been integrated into QIIME yet.
  datasets: contains data files that we used for our testing.
