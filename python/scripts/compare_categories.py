Analyzes distance matrices for information using statistical methods
"""

This script allows for the anaylsis of distance matrices using several \
statistical methods. These methods are Adonis, Anosim, BEST, DFA, Moran's I, \
MRPP, PERMANOVA, PERMDISP, RDA.

Adonis - This method takes a distance matrix and mapping file. It then \
identifies important points in the data and performs F-tests on the initial \
data, and random permutations(via  shuffling) the category data. Then, \
it finally returns the information that was identified in the samples. It's \
stated that it partitions (or seperates the data) for this analysis in order\
 to find underlying relationships.

Anosim - This method takes in a distance matrix and a mapping file. \
This method tests whether two or more categories are significantly \
different. You can specify a category in the metadata mapping file to separate \
samples into groups and then test whether there are significant differences \
between those groups. For example, you might test whether Control samples are \
significantly different from Fast samples. Since ANOSIM is non-parametric, \
significance is determined through permutations.

BEST - This method looks at the numerical environmental variables relating \
samples in a distance matrix. For instance, the unifrac distance matrix and \
pH and latitude (or any other number of variables) in soil samples, and ranks \
them in order of which best explain patterns in the communities.

Moran's I - This method takes in a distance matrix and mapping file. Then it \
uses the geographical data supplied to identify what type of spatial \
configuration occurs in the samples. Are they dispersed, clustered, or of no \
distinctly noticeable configuration when compared to each other?

MRPP - This method takes in a distance matrix and a mapping file. It then \
tests whether two or more categories are significantly different. You can \
specify a category in the metadata mapping file to separate samples into \
groups and then test whether there are significant differences between those \
groups. For example, you might test whether Control samples are significantly \
different from Fast samples. Since MRPP is non-parametric, significance is \
determined through permutations.

PERMANOVA - This method takes distance matrix and a mapping file. This method \
is for testing the simultaneous response of one or more variables to one or \
more factors in an ANOVA experimental design on the basis of any distance \
metric. It returns a R value and a P value.

PERMDISP - This method takes a distance matrix and a mapping file. \
This method is a procedure for the analysis of multivariate homogeneity of \
group dispersions (variances). Permutations can be utilized to measure the \
dissimilatities between groups.

RDA - This method takes a distance matrix and a mapping file. This method \
is an ordination method that shows grouping/clustering of samples based on \
a category in the metadata mapping file and a distance matrix. This category \
is used to explain the variability between samples. Thus, RDA is similar to \
PCoA except that it is constrained, while PCoA is unconstrained (you must \
specify which category should be used to explain the variability in your data).

Adonis: 
One file is created and outputs the results into it. The results will be:\
Analysis of variance(AOV) table, degrees of freedom, sequential sums of \
squares, mean squares, F statistics, partial R-squared and p-values, based \
on the N permutations.

Anosim: 
One file is output to the designated location under the name of \
anosim_results.txt. The information in the file will be an R-value and \
p-value.

Best: 
This outputs one file 'best_results.txt' It will have teh method name, \
The number of variables. The list of varibles supplied. And lastly, the \
RHO values, which are ranked pearson correlations for the best combination \
of variables that describe the community.

Moran's I: 
The output file is placed in a directory specified by -o. The file will be \
a text file with 4 values: observed, expected, sd, and p.value.
The observed value is Morans I index of x. This is computed based on the \
values passed in to be compared with the weights.
The expected value is the value of I under the null hypothesis.
The sd is the standard deviation of I under the null hypothesis.
P Value is the p-value of the test of the null hypothesis against the \
alternative hypothesis specified in alternative
Each of these values, except for the p-value, should be between -1 and 1.

MRPP: 
The command in the previous section creates a single output file in the \
directory specified by the -o arguement, if not it will be sent to the \
directory location it was called from. The file will be named mrpp_results.txt.\
 The file will contain a dissimilarity index, the class mean and counts. It \
will also conatin information about the chance corrected within-group \
agreement A, as well as the result Based on observed delta, and expected \
delta. There will also be the Significance of delta and the amount of permutations performed.

PERMANOVA: 
Permanova returns one output file containing the the file passed in, the \
F-value and the p-value.

PERMDISP: 
This method returns one file that outputs an analysis of varaiance table. \
Responses with the distances will be shown. There will be the strata \
relationship, then the sample information as well. Lastly you will be \
able to see the f-value and p-value.

RDA: 
RDA outputs a two files. One is calles rda_results.txt, the other file \
is rda_plot.pdf. rda.txt contains the Inertia Proportion Rank, the Eigenvalues for constrained axes, and the Eigenvalues for unconstrained axes.
