# This example is taken from http://thebiobucket.blogspot.com/2011/04/repeat-measure-adonis-lately-i-had-to.html#more
# and modified to work with R version 2.13.1 and vegan version 2.0-2.
#
# species matrix with 20 species abundances (mean = 50, sd = 10)
# one time variable, with 3 timepoints, which should be tested
# and a factor denoting sites that were repeatedly sampled (site)

# Load packages
require(vegan)

# Data:
sp <- matrix(rnorm(3 * 6 * 20, 50, 10), nrow = 3 * 6, ncol = 20, dimnames = list(1:18, paste("Sp", 1:20, sep = "")))

time <- as.ordered(rep(1:3, 6))
site <- gl(6, 3)
cbind(site, time, sp)

# add time effect at timepoint 3,
# this will effect will be tested by adonis():
sp_1 <- sp
sp_1[time==3,] <-  sp[time==3,] + rnorm(20, 10, 1)
cbind(site, time, sp_1)

# choose which species set to test:
test_sp <- sp_1

# computing the true R2-value

# (btw, using dist() defaults to euclidean distance):
print(fit <- adonis(dist(test_sp) ~ time, permutations=1))

# number of perms
B <- 1999

# setting up frame which will be populated by
# random r2 values:
pop <- rep(NA, B + 1)

# the first entry will be the true r2:
pop[1] <- fit$aov.tab[1, 5]

# set up a "permControl" object:
# we turn off mirroring as time should only flow in one direction
#ctrl <- permControl(strata = site, type = "series", mirror = FALSE)
ctrl <- permControl(strata = site, within = Within(type = "series", mirror =
FALSE), blocks = Blocks(type = "series", mirror = FALSE))

# Number of observations:
nobs <- nrow(test_sp)

# check permutation (...rows represent the sample id):
# ..they are ok!
#t(allPerms(nobs, control = ctrl, observed = FALSE)[1:20,])

# loop:
# in adonis(...) you need to put permutations = 1, otherwiseÂ 
# adonis will not run
for(i in 2:(B+1)){
     ###idx <- permuted.index2(nobs, control = ctrl)
     idx <- shuffle(nobs, control = ctrl)
     fit.rand <- adonis(dist(test_sp) ~ time[idx], permutations = 1)
     pop[i] <- fit.rand$aov.tab[1,5]
}

# get the p-value:
print(pval <- sum(pop >= pop[1]) / (B + 1))
# i got [1] 0.013

# the sign. p-value supports the H1 (->there is a time effect).
# ..and the fact that samples are not iid is allowed by 
# the customized perms - so this p-value is trustworthy as opposed
# to tests not acknowledging dependency of data points.. 

# test sp set without an effect:
# replace test_sp with sp set without effect:
test_sp <- sp

# now re-run the script and see the result:
# it is insign. - as expected:

# setting up frame which will be populated by
# random r2 values:
pop <- rep(NA, B + 1)

# computing the true R2-value:
print(fit <- adonis(dist(test_sp) ~ time, permutations=1))

# the first entry will be the true r2:
pop[1] <- fit$aov.tab[1, 5]

# run the loop:
for(i in 2:(B+1)){
     ###idx <- permuted.index2(nobs, control = ctrl)
     idx <- shuffle(nobs, control = ctrl)
     fit.rand <- adonis(dist(test_sp) ~ time[idx], permutations = 1)
     pop[i] <- fit.rand$aov.tab[1,5]
}
print(pval <- sum(pop >= pop[1]) / (B + 1))
# i got [1] 0.828

# make a histogram to see random R2-values and the true one:
#hist(pop, xlab = "Population R2")
#abline(v = pop[1], col = 2, lty = 3)
#text(0.08, 300, paste("true R2,\np = ", pval, sep = ""))
